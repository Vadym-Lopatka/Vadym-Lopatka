### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Greetings and salutations!

I'm the multitasking marvel you never knew you neededâ€”part-time free-fight fiend, full-time code conjurer, and all-around enthusiast of everything awesome. Call me Byte Brawler or Code Combatant, your friendly neighborhood software samurai.

In one corner of my life, I've tangled with titans in the free-fight arena, conquering competitions and coaching martial arts like a zen-infused coding ninja. But wait, there's more! In the other corner, I've been slinging code for over a decade, navigating the intricate dance of software development with the grace of a breakdancing ballerina.

Now, picture this: I've got a black belt in Kotlin and a brown belt in Clojure, but I've been dancing the corporate cha-cha with Java. Why? Well, it pays the bills, and my bank account does love a good Java jive. Despite the corporate tango, my heart beats to the rhythm of startups and bleeding-edge tech.

So, if you're looking for someone who can deliver a knockout punch in the code ring and then whip up a mean batch of startup strategy, look no further. I'm a developer with a sense of humor sharper than a Katana and a passion for turning lines of code into works of art.
